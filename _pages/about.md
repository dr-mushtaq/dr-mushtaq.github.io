I am **Mushtaq Hussain**, a regular faculty member at the [Virtual University of Pakistan](https://www.vu.edu.pk>).  I completed a Master of Information Technology (MIT) degree from the [University of Science and Technolog of Khoat](https://www.kust.edu.pk) Prior to pursuing my PhD, I earned a Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) from the [Agricultural University of Peshawar](https://www.aup.edu.pk).I then completed my PhD at [Shanghai University in China](https://apply.shu.edu.cn)under the supervision of **Professor Wu Zhang**."

üìö Research
======
My research focuses on the areas of **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision and NLP**.  In particular, my prior research endeavors have revolved around predicting student difficulty and engagement levels within e-learning environments, employing a range of machine learning techniques to uncover insights and improve educational outcomes My current research interests include, analyze student specialization selection patterns using machine learning and deep learning techniques

üí°I am Searching!
======
Currently, I am looking for Postdoc and Industrial Research Collaboration in Deep learning and Machine learning.
